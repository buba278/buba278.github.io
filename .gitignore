Gemfile.lock # Usually committed, but optional if everyone uses `bundle install` freshly
             # If you want to ensure exact gem versions, KEEP Gemfile.lock and REMOVE this line.
             # For GitHub Pages, it often rebuilds with its own versions, so ignoring can be fine.
             # However, for reproducible local builds, it's good to commit Gemfile.lock.
             # Let's lean towards COMMITTING Gemfile.lock for consistency.
